# AzureLoginSample

A minimal sample using azure login with dotnet core so I can refer to it and test this later.
It attempts to be minimal in

* Dependencies - only using aspnet's `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.OpenIdConnect` package.
* Configuration code - as minimal as possible anyway.
* Final claim cookie size - if this is important.
